Your business, **Humoni**, is a fintech platform designed to empower migrants, particularly international students, by providing access to essential financial and non-financial services. You are leveraging **open banking, alternative data, and a proprietary risk model** to solve the problem of financial exclusion that many migrants face when they arrive in a new country. 

### **Core Problem You Are Solving**
Migrants, especially international students, struggle to access financial services due to:
1. **Lack of Credit History** – Traditional lenders rely on past credit data, which migrants do not have.
2. **Difficulties in Renting** – Without local credit history, landlords and agents often require large upfront payments.
3. **Challenges in Employment** – Migrants often lack immediate access to job opportunities that match their skills.
4. **Financial Education Gap** – Many migrants are unfamiliar with local financial systems, making them vulnerable to high fees, scams, and financial mismanagement.

### **Your Solution**
Humoni acts as a **marketplace** that connects migrants to essential services, allowing them to integrate more seamlessly into their new country. Your platform is **not a lender** but instead facilitates access to services through strategic partnerships. 

Your **core offerings** include:
1. **Risk Model for Financial Services** – Using open banking data and alternative data sources, your model assesses the financial profile of new migrants, providing lenders with a better picture of their risk.
2. **Credit Building & Lending Products** – Connecting users to lenders offering credit-building loans and financial products.
3. **Housing Solutions** – Partnering with landlords and real estate companies to help migrants find rental properties without excessive upfront costs.
4. **Job & Training Opportunities** – Connecting migrants with job listings and training programs to improve employability.
5. **Financial Education & Budgeting Tools** – Providing resources to help users understand local financial systems and manage their money better.

### **Your Competitive Advantage**
Unlike other platforms, Humoni is creating an **all-in-one solution** that serves migrants from the moment they arrive. Your **key differentiators** include:
1. **First-Mover Advantage in Open Banking for Migrants** – Most competitors do not leverage open banking to assess new-to-country customers.
2. **Strong Customer Retention Strategy** – By addressing multiple pain points (housing, jobs, credit), you can keep users engaged for 5-7 years.
3. **Social Impact Focus** – Humoni aligns with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and has the potential to attract impact investors.
4. **Long-Term Scalability** – While starting in the UK, your model is replicable in other high-migration countries like Canada and Australia.

### **Revenue Model**
Humoni monetizes its services through:
1. **Referral Fees from Lenders** – A commission-based model for connecting users with financial products.
2. **Commissions from Third-Party Services** – Revenue from housing and job placement partners.
3. **Subscription Model (Future Phase)** – Potential for premium services once trust and traction are established.

### **Challenges & Solutions**
- **Regulatory Barriers** – You're avoiding complex lending regulations by operating as a **marketplace** rather than a direct lender.
- **Building Trust with Lenders** – To convince lenders to work with new migrants, you are developing a **robust risk model** backed by open banking data.
- **User Acquisition** – Your initial strategy focuses on **partnering with universities** and **targeted social media marketing**.

### **Vision & Future Expansion**
Your long-term goal is to **become the primary financial services platform for migrants**, providing everything from housing and employment to financial education and credit access. You plan to **expand to Canada, Australia, and other high-migration countries**, leveraging the same risk model and service partnerships.
